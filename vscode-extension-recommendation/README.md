# VSCode Extensions Recommendation for Web Development

Hello guys, this is my first post. In this article, we will talk about the extension for vscode. You may have known that extension make easier for developer to make a project, but you might confused which extension that you have to be used. Now, I have several extension recommendation for web development

<br>

<ul>
    <li>Bracket Pair Colorizer</li>
    <p>Bracket Pair Colorizer is an extension that allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. The brackets that you can use in this extension like for example : () = brackets, [] = square brackets, and {} = curly brackets</p>
    <li>Indent Rainbows</li>
    <p>This extension is very useful because it makes you easier to read or make indentation. The mechanism from this extension is it colorizes the indentation in front of your text alternating four different colors on each step. It can be used in all programming language</p>
    <li>Code Runner</li>
    <p>Code runner is an extension that it can run in multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Perl, Perl 6, Ruby, Go, Lua, Groovy, PowerShell, BAT/CMD, BASH/SH, F# Script, F# (.NET Core), C# Script, C# (.NET Core), VBScript, TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Scala, Swift, Julia, Crystal, OCaml Script, R, AppleScript, Elixir, Visual Basic .NET, Clojure, Haxe, Objective-C, Rust, Racket, Scheme, AutoHotkey, AutoIt, Kotlin, Dart, Free Pascal, Haskell, Nim, D, Lisp, Kit, V, SCSS, Sass, CUDA, Less, Fortran, Ring, and custom command. This extension will run code file in current text editor</p>
    <li>Live Server</li>
    <p>This extension usually useful for front end development. When you want to know the last changes in your results that you made in your code. This extension is very easy to use, just open the html file and you click right in your mouse and press "Open with Live Server", and then you open the result in your favorite web browsers</p>
    <li>Code Spell Checker</li>
    <p>Code spell checker works to catch if there are any errors in your code, and than it will display notifications in your current text editor. Definitely useful in all programming languages</p>
    <li>Prettier</li>
    <p>Prettier is a extension for code formatter. This extension will enforce a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. Even though you may not like the result of your clean code, but it's very useful</p>
    <li>Better Comments</li>
    <p>This is my favorite extension and I highly recommend that. Better comments will help you distinguish the comments in your code. You can categorize your comments into alerts, queries, TODOs, highlights, and other comment highlights</p>
    <li>Auto Rename Tag</li>
    <p>Auto Rename Tag is use when you wanna rename your one html tag and it will automatically rename the paired html tags</p>
    <li>Auto Close Tag</li>
    <p>Auto Close Tag is use when you wanna make your html tag and it will automatically add the tag in your current text editor</p>
</ul>

That's all my recommendations extension from VSCode. Hope you like it!
